# Examples

This folder contains basic usage examples for **react-bbox-annotator**.

Run the following command from the repository root to start a development server:

```bash
npm run examples
```

This will launch a Vite web server and open a page showing two examples:

1. A selector based example where labels are chosen from a list.
2. A text input based example for free form labels.

The code for these examples is located in `main.tsx`.
